# Initiative-tracker
The goal is to add character with their initiative stats and name.
The characters information is added to a "tracker" list which will sort made characters by their initiative stat from highest to lowest.
After starting an encounter a highlight will go through the characters in the list one by one until the encounter is ended.

What we might add: 
- Remove and add characters during encounter
- Awesome design
- Save encounters / sessions to DB ?
- An alert which tells whos turn is next and whos turn is now
